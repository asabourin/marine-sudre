		h2 About me
		p I was born in the south of France in Bordeaux on Dec 16th, 1989. I lived there until I was five years old, then my family decided to move to Australia.
		p I lived for two years in Brisbane and then came to Sydney. Although I have French backgrounds, Australia has become my home. Traveling is my biggest passion.
		p I started kitesurfing in 2005 with my father in Sydney. Since I was little I was drawn towards water sports. Kite surfing is sports that completely fulfills my passion for the water and has many characteristics of all those other sports combine in one.
		p Kite boarding has led me to so many places all around the world! Wherever I go, I always take my boards and my kites with me. There are still so many places I would like to discover such as: Venezuela, Turkey, Brazil, Greece, Canary Islands, Morocco, Mexico, etc.
